# Investment-Portfolio-Algorithm
An investment portfolio algorithm that combines my personal investment philosophy and skills learned from completing the Udemy course "Algorithmic Stock Trading and Equity Investing with Python".

## Introduction

Whilst I have designed other smaller algorithms whilst following the Udemy course, I cannot envision myself ever utilising them myself. The aim of this algorithm is to test all the financial, programming and 'soft' skills I have learned, whilst simulataneously creating something myself or others can utilise.

## Investment Strategy

My investment beliefs lie in low-risk long-only holding strategies. I believe most people do not have the skills, time or mental capacity to beat the market on a consistent basis with public investing, and should instead invest in index funds over a long time period utilising DCA. I have full faith in people being able to beat a market, but only if they commit a significant amount of time or resources (of which most working class people do not have) OR have exclusive market knowledge. In this regard, I believe trying to beat the market should be left to professional investors / traders / financial engineers. Generally, this results in average returns of somewhere between 5-10% annually (S&P500), which is still quite impressive, but not enough to make you a millionaire over a short time frame. After reading this---- post by Benjamin Todd (foudner of 80,000 hours), I was inspired to try something different.

## Strategy Execution

- No fundamental influencers are included; a stock may rapidly rise because of overwhelmingly positive financial reports or media coverage. These stocks may not revert to their average value.
- No purchase variance between the most significant outlier stocks VS standard outlier stocks
- Overall market picture is not viewed / lack of safety net; index could be rapidly growing and we will continue to short stocks

## Conclusion

- No fundamental influencers are included; a stock may rapidly rise because of overwhelmingly positive financial reports or media coverage. These stocks may not revert to their average value.
- No purchase variance between the most significant outlier stocks VS standard outlier stocks
- Overall market picture is not viewed / lack of safety net; index could be rapidly growing and we will continue to short stocks
